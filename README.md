# clone-command
Clone command using the DD function within a terminal window

This simple program allows a user to create a bit for bit copy of any storage volume onto another drive.  Current use case for myself is for creating duplicate USBs
which have a bitlocker encryption on them. 

Long term I would like this to be able to create a hash of all the files and folders within the given directory and automatically save this where the user wants.
